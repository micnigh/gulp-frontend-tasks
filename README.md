A collection of common front end gulp tasks.

# Quick start

See examples

# Why?

I've found myself reusing most of the same tasks with slight variations.  Over time I've abstracted most of these tasks so they can be created with a minimal amount of configuration.

# TODO

- Add karma task
- Add livereload, browsersync, or similar
- Add scss task
- Organize dependencies
